    excerpt: 'Everything you need to know before purchasing your next GPU for gaming or work.',
    content: `<p>Choosing the right graphics card depends on your specific needs and budget. For 1080p gaming, mid-range cards like RTX 4060 or RX 7600 offer excellent performance. For 4K gaming, consider high-end options like RTX 4080 or RX 7800 XT.</p>
    
    <p>Key factors include VRAM capacity, power consumption, and cooling solutions. More VRAM is essential for modern games and content creation. Efficient cooling keeps temperatures low and performance stable.</p>
